GaluhbeezLocation Sample
=====================

Introduction
============

This sample shows a simple way of getting a device's current location for use in future projects

The goal is to use the fab to get your current location as a pop up message at the bottom of the screen.

The accuracy of the location returned is based on the location
permissions you've requested and the location sensors that are currently active
for the device.

To run this sample, ***location must be enabled***.

This sample uses
[Google Play services (GoogleApiClient)](ihttps://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/api/GoogleApiClient.html)
and the
[FusedLocationApi] (https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/LocationServices.html).

To run this sample, **location must be enabled**.
